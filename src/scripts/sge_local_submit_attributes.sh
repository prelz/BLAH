# The memory and wall time requirements as passed from the job
# description file (JDL) need to be passed on to the local batch
# system. This script, when installed in /opt/glite/bin, will be
# called by BLAH moments before the job is submitted to the Torque
# batch system.

# The requirements are passed according the tho GLUE schema, and for
# the purposes of this script involve the properties
# MainMemoryRAMSize, and MaxWallClockTime.

# see the GlUE Schema v1.3, http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/Spec/V13

# See http://grid.pd.infn.it/cream/field.php?n=Main.ForwardOfRequirementsToTheBatchSystem

# The requirements will have been translated from their original Glue
# form into shell variables; upper and lower bounds are indicated by
# appending _Max or _Min, respectively, to the variable name.

# Some care must be taken to pass only sensible values, i.e. numbers,
# lest we leave opportunity to befoul the submit script with stray
# parameters. 

# The assumption here is, and it will have to be checked, that all
# values are specified as integer decimal numbers.

# For a treatise on parameter passing to Torque, see
# http://www.clusterresources.com/torquedocs21/2.1jobsubmission.shtml#nodeExamples.

# Part 1: memory requirements
# The parameter to watch for is called MainMemoryRamSize. 
# this is specified in megabytes according to Glue.

memmin="$GlueHostMainMemoryRAMSize_Min"

# If the user was so careless to ask for an exact match instead of
# a minimum, the variable name is different.
if [ -z "$memmin" ]; then
    memmin="$GlueHostMainMemoryRAMSize"
fi

# At this point $memmin is either empty, if no requirement was given,
# or some string. It must be a number but let's make sure by using
# the test below.
if [ $memmin -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "#$ -l s_rss=${memmin}M"
fi

# The virtual memory size gets mostly the same treatment as the phsical memory (resident set size).

vmemmin="$GlueHostMainMemoryVirtualSize_Min"

# If the user was so careless to ask for an exact match instead of
# a minimum, the variable name is different.
if [ -z "$vmemmin" ]; then
    vmemmin="$GlueHostMainMemoryVirtualSize"
fi

# At this point $memmin is either empty, if no requirement was given,
# or some string. It must be a number but let's make sure by using
# the test below.
if [ $vmemmin -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "#$ -l s_vmem=${vmemmin}M"
fi

# Part 2: Wall clock time requirement.
#
# While the memory specification according to the Glue schema is a
# property of a Compute Element, the maximum (wall clock) time a job
# can spend is set by policy. A curious aspect of the Glue schema is
# the subtle difference between the meaning of MaxWallClockTime and
# MaxObtainableWallClockTime.
